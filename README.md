# flask-reminders (wip)
App with Python Flask, MongoDB and Elasticsearch that I use to to bookmark websites/resources.

## Motivation:

I tend to make a lot of notes and save info from websites quite alot. But after some time I forget where, what was saved. 

So I made this app to have a quick way to save bookmarks, by specifying the title, category, description and url. Adding info was one part of the app, but the functionality that I really needed, was a view where I can see what was added, from a newest to olderst view.

## Services Used:

* MongoDB
* Elasticsearch
* Python Flask

## Planned Features

* Search Functionality (wip)
* URL Generation for User Defined Notes. Instead of using a URL, the ability to create a note and attach the autogenerated link for your note.
